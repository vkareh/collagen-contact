Collagen Contact
================

This module provides a contact form in a [Collagen.js](http://collagenjs.org)
website.

To install, run `npm install collagen-contact` from within your `/app` directory
and add `require('collagen-contact')` to your `/app/index.js` file.

The contact form can now be found by navigating to `/contact` or by clicking on
the "Contact" link in the top navigation bar.

All contact messages will be sent to the email configured in your
`collagen.json` file.
